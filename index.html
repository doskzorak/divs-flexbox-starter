                <p>I am a <span class="bold-text">Responsive
                    Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on
                    making sure others are making forward motion
                    in their lives by giving them a home on the 
                    Internet. When I'm not glued to my computer,
                    master crafting websites, I like to read, learn,
                    and spend time with family.

                <p>I was born in Los Angeles, and my parents
                    both grew up in California. However, my
                    dad was born in Texas and I spent many
                    summers there visiting his family. Texas
                    is a great state, and I would like to go
                    there more often.

                    and they are the most important part of my
                    life. It can be frustrating at times, but
                    it is completely worth it in the end.

                    I find that I should have been here a lot sooner. The people
                    are nice, for the most part, and the food is fantastic! I have
                    also been able to focus my path to where I want to go.
